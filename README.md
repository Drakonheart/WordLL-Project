# WordLL-Project
WordLL Game is a Java-based word-guessing challenge inspired by the popular game "Wordle." Players aim to guess a secret word within limited attempts by receiving feedback on their guesses. The project includes classes managing word guesses, letters, and game logic, fostering an interactive and engaging word-guessing experience.



# WordLL Game

Welcome to the Wordle Game repository!

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a word-guessing game similar in concept to the popular game "Wordle". The game challenges players to guess a mystery word within a limited number of attempts. Each guess provides feedback about the correctness of the letters in the guessed word, guiding players to deduce the mystery word.

## Gameplay

In the WordLL Game:

- Players have a certain number of attempts to guess a secret word.
- After each guess, feedback is provided indicating which letters are correct, used, or unused.
- The objective is to deduce the secret word based on this feedback within the given attempts.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key components:

- **Letter.java**: Represents a single letter used in the game, with labeling functionality.
- **Word.java**: Represents a word comprised of letters and manages letter labeling.
- **WordLL.java**: Manages the game logic, including the mystery word and past guesses.
- **ExtendedLetter.java**: A subclass extending Letter's functionality.

## Running the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a Java environment set up.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run the WordLLExamples class to start the game.

## Contribution

Contributions to enhance the game or fix issues are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and create a pull request. Please adhere to the project's coding standards and follow the contribution guidelines.
